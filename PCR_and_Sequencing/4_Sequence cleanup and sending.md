# Sephex - sequence cleanup
### Purpose
To clean the PRC product that have been went through the Big-dye sequencing reaction. 

### Slurry mix
For one plate
- sephadex G50 Fine: 1.25g
- ddH2O: 20ul

### Protocol

Add 200 + 200 ul of slurry to Princeton Separation Sephadex plate (smaller one), place plate on the top and bigger one at the bottom, fixed it by tape

Spin for 2 min at 1500 RPM

Immediately add all sequence reaction (12 ul) to the sephadex column (smaller one, where sephadex remained)

Place sephadex plate over a sequence plate (shelf next to the window, check if the order of samples correspond to order on sequence plate and tape it)

Spin for 2 min at 1500 RPM

Sequence reactions are clean. Cover the wells with by plastic lid (shelf next to the window), write down **order number** on the side of the plate, wrap by paper towel, fix by tapes

Fill the FedEx form, place into the smaller plastic bag and place on the bigger plastic bag.

Also, see the paper copy of this protocol in the orange folder.
